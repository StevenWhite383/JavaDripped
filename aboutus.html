            <img src="./images/aboutfuture.png" alt="Picture of JavaDipped holding the Earth">
            <p>Since the beginning, JavaDripped has harbored an audacious and all-encompassing plan to dominate not just the coffee world, but the entire world itself. With a calculated and sinister approach, JavaDripped has been laying the groundwork for global supremacy since its inception. Concealing its true intentions beneath a veil of sophistication and excellence, the company has stealthily infiltrated various industries, using its vast resources and influence to manipulate markets, control governments, and manipulate the very fabric of society. Through a carefully orchestrated campaign of addiction and dependency, JavaDripped has ensnared the masses, exploiting their insatiable desire for its addictive brew. With each sip, the world falls further under their malevolent spell, oblivious to the dark forces pulling the strings. As the world trembles under the weight of their dominance, JavaDripped's sinister plot inches closer to fruition, a dystopian nightmare where every corner of the globe is enslaved under the reign of a single, malevolent coffee empire.</p>
